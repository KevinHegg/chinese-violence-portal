# public/lynchings.json

**Do not edit this file directly.**

This file is automatically generated from `src/data/lynchings.json` by the build process.

- The source of truth is `src/data/lynchings.json`.
- On every build (or when you run `npm run prebuild`), this file is overwritten with the latest data from `src/data/lynchings.json`.
- Any manual changes here will be lost.

If you need to update the lynching data, edit `src/data/lynchings.json` and run:

```
npm run prebuild
```

or

```
npm run build
```

This will keep the map and all Astro-generated pages in sync with the latest data.
