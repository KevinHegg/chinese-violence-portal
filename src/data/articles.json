    "article-transcript": "A SERIOUS SERMON AT THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY GATHERING⏎The Presence of Chinese - Serious evils, and Redeeming Elements - Some Points for Reflection and Reformation.⏎Pacific Hall was well filled last evening with a fashionable congregation, when a special \"anniversary\" meeting of the mission located there was convened. The exercises were under the auspices of the \"Pacific Sabbath and Union\" - better known as the Railroad mission - and were led by Rev. L. Hamilton, Pastor of the First Baptist Church. Rev. Hamilton discoursed on the subject of the riots which startled the community and threatened to destroy peace and order, as he termed it. He commenced his remarks after the singing of the doxology and a text selected from the nineteenth chapter of Proverbs.⏎After having offered up an earnest prayer that discordant elements might remain subdued, and forever peace and order in this community should reign, he said in substance:⏎It is a year ago since the spirit of riot took possession of the people and the peace of the city was disturbed. The cause which produced this result is not local. It is not confined to this place or this city, but is general. There is a tendency among the laboring class, not of foreign birth alone, but of native origin, to regard foreign laborers as interlopers and obstacles in the way of their own employment and prosperity. There is an antagonism which has its root in human nature and which must be corrected by higher principles of humanity and justice.⏎A TERRIBLY FRUITFUL VENGEANCE⏎In summary it came to pass, 1. A winter unprecedented in severity followed the riot, causing great suffering to the laboring class. 2. This was succeeded by the most disastrous flood ever known in the State, which swept away thousands of homes and destroyed the means of subsistence of thousands of the most helpless and dependent class. 3. The city was then visited with an epidemic of small-pox, the most fatal in its results ever known in our midst. The same class suffered most. 4. A general financial depression followed, affecting trade and diminishing the wages of labor, and increasing the number of unemployed. 5. The spirit of violence, the outgrowth of the riot, reappeared in the assassination of a man who had been identified with one of the most influential corporations. 6. The United States government suspended work on the fortifications of the harbor. 7. The destruction of property by fire has been beyond precedent. 8. Destructive storms, culminating in an earthquake shock, have added their testimony. These are some of the events which have followed the disturbances. They are warnings and judgments which should be heeded. If we cast out of the⏎IMPERISHABLE ELEMENTS OF ANARCHY,⏎by one act, our community will be relieved of a vast amount of misery and future sorrow. We need the development of moral spirit, the pledging and agreement of men against violence, and against all mobs. We need organized opposition to the evil tendencies of the day.⏎The late disturbances in our city were not approved. The better classes discountenanced them. An authoritative voice was soon heard in the name of the law, and the working men withdrew from the movement. There was a significant reaction. This reaction is the best evidence of hope for the future. We should see to it, however, that among the disturbing causes of last year the subject of Chinese immigration has not been neglected.⏎In touching the question there was no racial prejudice. No hatred, no bitterness, and no opposition to any one on account of color. It is not the Chinaman as a man that is disliked, but the system of labor he represents. This is the grievance. It is the spirit of caste, the result of monopolized labor and of servile employment of laborers. The system must be removed, not by violence, but by lawful and righteous means. The Chinaman is the subject of pity. Let the real object of attack be the system and not the individual.⏎DELIVERED BY AUTHORITY⏎With the rekindled love of peace and justice, we can proceed. Power must no longer be given to mobs. Every right-thinking man, whether laboring or capitalistic, should unite in discountenancing mob law. Let us all protest against the disposition to resort to mob rule. Let our aim be reform in labor, through legislative and moral means. Our city should recover its reputation.⏎We must be honest. If we are not honest, no cause can prosper. The rights of all men must be protected. The laborer has rights as well as the capitalist. There is room for both. Let us lift our fellow men by giving them fair opportunities. No people, however good, can prosper if they trample on others. The real question is, how shall we make the laboring man contented?⏎Much more others THE LABORERS⏎We hear much about labor. We are told that it is honorable. But the kind of labor most in demand is that which is attended with honor. No man can be a good laborer who is a bad citizen. Let us improve the social condition of the laboring class. That is the way to elevate labor.⏎All our frustration will be in vain, unless the Chinese question is settled. The Government of the United States must act.⏎In 1876, a memorial, largely signed, was sent to Congress, from California, setting forth the dangers of unrestricted immigration. It had little effect. Legislation has been slow. The demand is now urgent.⏎It is not a local question. It is national, moral and social. It affects the whole country. We are not opposed to the Chinaman on account of race, but because of the effect of his labor system. Let us have national legislation. Let us remove the evils by peaceful means. Let the people educate themselves. Let labor and capital combine. Let us have justice and charity.⏎AS BROAD AS PURPOSE.⏎We should employ honorable men. Every industry requires men of intelligence and probity. No good cause should be stained by association with rowdyism. Let our public meetings be characterized by order and decency. Let the influence of the Sabbath school and the church be made to bear.⏎There is no room for mobs. No decent man should be identified with them. Let the citizens take a stand. Let us labor for the moral regeneration of society. Let the laborer elevate himself. Let him adopt better ways. Let every good man strive to suppress mob law. Let there be no more riots. Let our laws be enforced. Then we shall have better times.",

    "article-title": "Great Excitement at Jacksonville—Pursuit of the Robber Joaquin",
    "article-transcript": "The Sacramento papers have long accounts of a warm and exciting chase after the famous robber Joaquin.⏎On Friday last the citizens of Jacksonville brought in the dead body of Mr. Lake, a butcher, of that place, and the body of a Chinaman, who was wounded by a pistol ball. It was not then known who had committed these outrages. On the next day, Saturday, three Chinamen were killed between Sutter and Jackson, a distance of some four miles. The driver of the Stockton stage and two passengers were killed on the same day by Joaquin and two others, supposed to be Mexicans. The three men were shot and the horses taken from the stage.⏎On the same day, the same parties drove some fifty Chinese from a camp in the neighborhood, and carried away or destroyed their tents. On the Thursday previous, Joaquin rode through the village of San Andreas at a quick gallop, and shot three Americans as he passed through the streets. Joaquin is a young man, of about nineteen years of age, and must be one of the best shots with a revolver in this or any other country, as nearly all these men were shot through the neck. The whole band, it is supposed, consists of about sixty men, all of whom are thought to be Mexicans.⏎A letter from Jacksonville, dated 13th inst., says: \"The town is under the greatest excitement. A large meeting of the citizens was held this evening, at which measures were taken that must lead to the eventual capture of the murderers. Nearly our whole population has volunteered to turn out in pursuit to-morrow. Wo to the Mexicans if they are caught.\"⏎The party of Americans who started in pursuit, found at Cook's Gulch, on Sutter Creek, the dead body of a Chinaman. They traced the robbers to Jackson Creek, a few miles below this village, and there found more of their work—one Chinaman mortally wounded. Mr. Lake was living, but speechless, and died in a few minutes after the arrival of the Americans. He had been shot twice, and stabbed through the neck, and his mule taken.⏎The American party followed on, and soon overtook the Mexicans who had committed all these murders. The villains managed to escape, with the loss of their horses, blankets, &c., and one and perhaps two of them were wounded.⏎One of the party, worn out by fatigue, having been in hot pursuit of the robbers for six days, returned to Sacramento with three horses captured from a portion of Joaquin's party. The utmost excitement prevails throughout the mines.",

Fitzgerald with 50 men, and a battle fought, in which 30 Indians and 12 soldiers are reported to have been killed.⏎Mrs. Waggoner and child were murdered; and five other families along the route pursued by the Indians are said to have shared the same fate.⏎The whole number of whites who have already fallen, from the best accounts, is between 30 and 50.⏎A volunteer force of 125 men had also attacked the Indians, who were totally routed, leaving 40 dead on the field.⏎Of the volunteers 12 men were wounded; one of their number, Major Lupton, who had received an arrow in the left breast, died on Monday night, and another, named Sheppard, wounded in the abdomen, it is thought will not recover..",

Lee’s place with a rope about his neck, and his skull crushed in with boots and bricks.⏎The police were unable to control the mob.⏎The fire department was ordered to throw water on the rioters, but the mob attacked them and badly wounded two firemen.⏎Many Chinamen were fearfully beaten.⏎One was rescued by the police and taken to jail, which was immediately surrounded by a mob of about 1000, who hurrahed for Hancock and yelled “lynch the leper.”⏎About dark the mob were entirely beyond control and marched from street to street, gutting Chinese houses and assaulting citizens.⏎From an isolated tenement a Chinaman was dragged, his ears cut off and otherwise terribly mutilated.⏎He was finally rescued in a dying condition.⏎Several are reported killed.⏎Many colored men were knocked down and beaten.⏎At this hour the rioters are still on the streets in full force.⏎There is a great fear of incendiarism to-night.⏎The transparencies carried in the democratic procession Saturday night were devoted altogether to the Chinese, and this with the constant repetitions of the Garfield forgery, are the causes of the mob.⏎There is a dangerous night ahead.⏎The Chinese population here cannot exceed one hundred and fifty.",

It is variously reported that, from $11,000 to $20,000 has been stolen from the Chinese quarters.⏎In one of their stores, a box containing $5,000 was broken open, and the money extracted.⏎One Chinaman was robbed of $450 on being taken to jail. All the Chinamen hanged were stripped of all their valuables while being dragged to the place of execution.⏎Trunks and other repositories, having locks, in the various tenements occupied by the Chinese, have been broken open and ransacked, and everything of value carried off.⏎Eighteen Chinamen were hanged yesterday. They presented a most shocking and horrible sight.⏎Their clothing was torn, and in one or two cases the victims were almost nude.⏎Their countenances were besmeared with blood, and their heads and bodies pierced with gunshot wounds, and some of them fearfully mutilated.⏎The ropes by which they were hanged were still attached to their necks, and a number of them were shot previous to being hanged.⏎One or two of the victims had their bodies riddled with bullets.⏎The threatened repetition of the tragedy last night did not transpire, a strong guard having been placed to prevent it, as it was rumored yesterday that they would make another haul in the evening on the other side of Negro alley.⏎The examination of witnesses at the Coroner’s inquest occupied the whole of yesterday afternoon and was resumed this morning.⏎It is now recess.⏎Witnesses are very careful in giving their testimony, fearing to name individuals whom they know to have taken an active part in the lynching, lest they may be similarly dealt with themselves.⏎Sufficient evidence has already been adduced implicating two Irishmen, one having boasted of being instrumental in killing Chinese.⏎The examination will certainly continue throughout the day, possibly it will not be concluded until to-morrow.⏎It is now stated the old Vigilantes are the real instigators of the lynching, and that their declaration of determination to preserve the peace is merely a blind to throw off suspicion.⏎Three or four Chinamen who are said to have done the shooting at citizens and officers are still at large; only one of those hanged is known to have been a party to the shooting.⏎Information has just been received of the arrest of the Chinaman who shot Officer Bill Tuck, who commenced the shooting on Tuesday night, was captured this afternoon.⏎The Coroner’s inquest was adjourned until to-morrow.⏎Four arrests of rioters were made this afternoon, and direct testimony was given implicating them as concerned in the hanging of Chinamen.⏎Judge Sepulveda to-day ordered a special grand jury returnable Tuesday, October 31.⏎A large number of Chinese fled from the city by all roads on the night of the riot.⏎Some took the overland road for the north, on foot, leaving everything behind, and many are getting ready to leave.⏎The report that the rioters ordered all the Chinese to leave the city within forty-eight hours was untrue.⏎Some of the prominent rioters are said to have left the city.",

    "article-transcript": "COLUSA, CAL., July 11.—At about 12:30 yesterday morning Hong Di, the Chinese domestic who murdered Mrs. Billyon at St. John some time ago, was taken from jail and hanged by a mob.⏎The murderer had been on trial for several days, and a verdict of guilty was returned Saturday, the jury fixing his punishment at imprisonment for life.⏎The circumstances of the murder are as follows: Hong Si had been severely reprimanded by Mrs. Billyon for some shortcoming on his part, and it had been noticed for a day or two that he was surly and morose.⏎On the day of the murder Mr. Billyon, who was a wealthy rancher, was absent in San Francisco on business.⏎Mrs. Billyon, her two daughters and William Weaver, head servant man, were sitting at supper, when the door of the dining room was thrown open by Hong Di, the cook, who leveled a Winchester rifle at Weaver and shot him through the shoulder.⏎He fell on the floor, and a second shot went through Mrs. Billyon's heart, killing her instantly.⏎Both daughters fled to an adjoining room and escaped uninjured.⏎The Chinaman fled and Weaver managed to get on his feet and lock the door.⏎No trace of the murderer could be seen for nearly a week, when he was found on the banks of the Sacramento river nearly starved to death.⏎The circumstances of this assassination were still fresh in the mind of everyone, and on hearing the verdict the crowd became exasperated.⏎The judge refused to accept the decision of the jury and a wild scene at once began.⏎Almost every man present was armed and in an instant a hundred pistols were drawn amid cries of “Lynch him!”⏎The sheriff jumped to his feet and quieted the crowd long enough to say that while he disapproved of the verdict he hoped no blood would be shed in court.⏎The crowd left the court room and the prisoner was removed to jail.⏎Soon an effort was being arranged to lynch the Chinaman, and while the sheriff and his charge were inside a large and determined mob was forming outside the jail.⏎All day long the crowds kept on the street, but no effort was made to get at the prisoner until near midnight.⏎At that time the town was alive with strangers from surrounding places, including the captain of a steamer and twenty of her crew.⏎Citizens were posted at all avenues of escape, and about 12:30 a break was made for the jail.⏎Guards had been posted by the sheriff, but as they were in sympathy with those on the outside little resistance was made.⏎In a few minutes the assassin was in the avengers’ hands.⏎Weaver, the man whom he had shot first, was present, rope in hand.⏎The prisoner was at once dragged out and conveyed to the bridge, shrieking and screaming in terror.⏎His cries were addressed to deaf ears, however.⏎The rope was put around his neck despite his desperate struggle, half a dozen men raised him in their arms and he was tossed over the parapet.⏎The wretched being was probably half dead when thrown over.⏎He struggled feebly a few moments and then the assassin of Mrs. Billyon swung quietly.⏎Shortly afterward the body was cut down by order of the sheriff and carried to the jail.",

She claims that he waylaid her in the park last Saturday, and that a guard saved her from assault. Today, she says, he lurked about the house until she went out on an errand.

Work was commenced, but the Chinamen were waited upon by a committee of twenty-five white miners, who ordered them to leave the camp by the next morning.⏎They did so and came here where they camped, awaiting orders from the white boss, who went on to Denver to invoke the aid of the federal authorities. The mine is owned by the Argonaut Mining Co., of Denver, but has been leased to a boss Chinaman who has charge of the Chinese gangs working in the Rock Springs coal mines.⏎The miners are determined that Chinese laborers shall not come in here while there are idle men and cut wages to $1.50 a day, the rate the Chinese admit they are to receive. If officers come to prevent the white men from interfering with coolie labor there will be trouble. At this time it is hard to tell what will be the outcome, but in the first demand the miners have won, and if the Chinese win in the next movement it is the intention of their boss to bring in many more of the same class.",

He is clean, apparently.⏎Also, he will steal like a cat.⏎Taken collectively, he is a foul, ill-smelling, pestilential mass. Chinatown offends every sense. It reeks with smells, and sights, and sounds disgusting in the extreme. It is the abode of leprosy, adultery, gambling, and murder.⏎They have their secret tribunals where their victims are done to death according to Asiatic laws, and it is next to impossible for the American laws to find them out.⏎Only last week a Chinaman was hanged in Sacramento who was supposed to have been the victim of Chinese justice. He had first been murdered, and then suspended to a hook in the ceiling to convey the impression of suicide.⏎They were partly betrayed by one of their own countrymen, but he very soon found it advisable to declare that he had made a mistake.⏎They act upon Madame de Stael’s doctrine: Whatever they do is right until they are found out.⏎In short, the most liberal-minded seem willing to concede that if the Chinese have done some good in opening the resources of the country, they have also done some harm.⏎Whatever may be the opinion of any one East or West, the question has reached a grave issue in California.⏎Something must be done.⏎The extreme lower class of the mob is riotous, turbulent, and difficult to restrain.⏎The better-thinking class is quite as determined, if less noisy in demonstration.⏎Mr. Mills is boldly accused of misrepresentation, and his statements have done very much to stir the disquiet in the breasts of the working people.⏎They have discovered that mob violence does them no good, and, having so discovered, they are going to make a very earnest trial of the other course of action.⏎The rumors which travel eastward of threatened outbreaks or violence of any kind are all grossly exaggerated.⏎But such a stand has been taken that it cannot result in nothing.⏎The more popular idea is to limit Chinese immigration, while nothing but fanatics think of driving away those who are here, or abusing them while they remain.⏎After all, it is the millions who threaten to come that people are frightened by, rather than the thousands who are here.",

The Chinamen will be domiciled in the freight house until their cabins are rebuilt. The announcement was made last night that the Chinese will go to work in the mines this morning and that white men would not be permitted to work any more.⏎The plan is to protect the Chinese with troops until the white men are forced to leave town, when the troops can be withdrawn. No demonstration against the Celestials has been made as yet, but it is safe to say that serious trouble will ensue as soon as the opportunity affords. The presence of so large a body of soldiers will prevent any open act of violence, but the white miners assert that the Chinese must go in spite of Uncle Sam’s protection.⏎Hundreds of rumors were afloat last night regarding the plans, and soldiers and citizens are in a state of suppressed excitement, momentarily expecting an outbreak of some sort.⏎The Chinese quarters have been surrounded by a strong picket line, and all the buildings belonging to the company, Beckwith, Quinn & Co.’s store, the powder magazine and the entrances to the different mines are all under guard, as it is said the miners have threatened to blow them up. The situation is serious in the extreme, and the feeling prevails everywhere that on account of the bringing of Chinamen back, the destruction of property by fire and explosives is sure to follow, and it is not unlikely that a general strike may ensue, as the employees all along the line of the road are in sympathy with the miners.",

    "article-transcript": "COLUSA, Cal., July 11.—At about 12:30 yesterday morning Hong Di, the Chinese domestic who murdered Mrs. Billyon at St. John, some time ago, was taken from the jail and hanged by a mob. The murderer had been on trial for several days and a verdict of guilty was returned Saturday, the jury fixing his punishment at imprisonment for life.⏎The circumstances of the murder are as follows: Hong Di had been severely reprimanded by Mrs. Billyon for some shortcoming on his part and it had been noticed for a day or two that he was surly and morose. On the day of the murder Mrs. Billyon, who was a wealthy rancher, was absent in San Francisco on business. Mrs. Billyon, her two daughters and William Weaver, head servant man, were sitting at supper when the door of the dining room was thrown open by Hong Di, the cook, who leveled a Winchester rifle at Weaver and shot him through the shoulder. He fell on the floor and a second shot went through Mrs. Billyon’s heart, killing her instantly. Both daughters fled to an adjoining room and escaped uninjured. The Chinaman fled and Weaver managed to get on his feet and lock the door. No trace of the murderer could be seen for nearly a week, when he was found on the banks of the Sacramento River, nearly starved to death.⏎The circumstances of this assassination were still fresh in the mind of every one, and, on hearing the verdict, the crowd became exasperated. The Judge refused to accept the decision of the jury and a wild scene at once began. Almost every man present was armed and in an instant 100 pistols were drawn amid cries of “Lynch him.” The Sheriff jumped to his feet and quieted the crowd long enough to say that while he disapproved of the verdict he hoped no blood would be shed in court. The crowd left the court room and the prisoner was removed to jail.⏎Soon an effort was being arranged to lynch the Chinaman and, while the Sheriff and his charge were inside, a large and determined mob was forming outside the jail. All day long the crowds kept on the street, but no effort was made to get at the prisoner until near midnight. At that time the town was alive with strangers from surrounding places, including the captain of a steamer and twenty of his crew.⏎Citizens were posted at all avenues of escape and about 12:30 a break was made for the jail. Guards had been posted by the sheriff, but as they were in sympathy with those on the outside, little resistance was made. In a few minutes the assassin was in the avengers’ hands. Weaver, the man whom he had shot first was present, rope in hand. The prisoner was at once dragged out and conveyed to the bridge, shrieking and screaming in terror. His cries were addressed to deaf ears, however. The rope was put around his neck despite his desperate struggles, half a dozen men raised him in their arms and he was tossed over the parapet. The wretched being was probably half dead when thrown over. He struggled feebly a few moments and then the assassin of Mrs. Billyon swung quietly. Shortly afterward his body was cut down by order of the sheriff and taken.",

Every Chinese laundry in the city has been raided, and most of the Celestial heathens have been given refuge in the police stations.

On First avenue early last evening a mob caught a washer-man and put a rope around his neck, but he was rescued by the police.⏎The people are terribly worked up over the outrages that have been perpetrated by the heathens, and it is only a matter of a few hours when the city will be rid of them.",

The steamer plies regularly between San Francisco and Puget sound. At this hour, 2 p. m., about 100 Chinamen have been put on board. On an attempt being made by the rioters to force the Chinese on board without paying their fare, which is $10 in each case, the captain stationed men with hose, prepared to throw five streams of water into the mob if such an attempt was made.⏎The mayor of Seattle and other prominent citizens telegraphed to Vancouver barracks, asking General Gibbon, commanding the department of Columbia, for troops. Gen. Gibbon has telegraphed the war department but no authority has yet come from Washington to send troops. Vancouver is distant about 150 miles from Seattle and transportation could be effected by boat and rail. The shortest time in which troops could be transported is seven hours, and even if they should start to-night, they would be too late to prevent the expulsion of the Chinese. Chief Justice Green, of Washington Territory, has telegraphed Attorney General Garland asking him to use his influence and have troops ordered to Seattle. As yet no blood or incendiary has occurred, but it is believed to-night there will be serious trouble.",

    "article-transcript": "An Eye Witness' Account of the Scene⏎Los Angeles, although boasting of being the city of the Queen of Angels, is cursed with a spot unwashed of crime and depravity, whose black valley, as San Francisco has in its Barbary coast and Chinatown. The negro alley is a small street connecting with the very business portion of the city. It is inhabited by a dense mass of degraded, one-storied shanties, built of adobe and wood, standing in striking contrast with its neighbors of brick and iron fronts. The street is crowded with workshops, the din and whirr of whose machinery are deafening. In this accursed spot, deserted by law and order, congregate the burglars, pickpockets and harlots of all nationalities, but more especially of the Mongolian persuasion. It is in these two-thirds of the buildings are occupied by Chinese, and into whose midst the Celestials are thrown by immigration. Scarcely a day passes without quarrels and disturbances between them. Outbreaks are uniform, and firearms are resorted to by the parties on more than one occasion. And such was the case on Monday last, when occurred the present tragedy we perform. The sheriff met the rival companions and had signs of concealed wounds, which, it is alleged, the one party—\"the Hop Company\"—had abducted from the other—the \"Ah Chop Company\" by the aid of \"Mexican\" fashion with \"his own men,\" so to precipitate the general finally seated in the parish drawing pistols and firing. All escaping uninjured, although \"Bling's\" coat was perforated by the two balls fired at him. The parties were arrested, and the case came up before the Justice of the Peace for preliminary examination. The prisoners were called at 10 o'clock. The alley was long since pronounced unsafe. It is estimated that from $500,000 to $1,000,000 worth of goods exist in the midst of the most desperate neighborhood, and in the very heart of one of the most flourishing cities of the continent. While one party was in the office, with one officer, the other guard, sent off to summon a witness, left the alley unguarded. A shout arose. The mob rushed in. It is estimated that about 3,000 in less than ten minutes. The affray resulted in the death of at least seventeen, and the wounding of as many more. The worst passions were aroused. Among the slain were ten Chinamen. The crowd surged on. They burned buildings and sacked shops. Some of them, it is stated, were stripped and left naked. A Chinese boy was shot, cocked and placed against the wall. One of the excited mob endeavored to plunge his knife into the Chinaman’s back, striking the captor’s hand in its stead. When about two-thirds of the crowd were in sight, the mob, now maddened, were crying “Hang him! hang him!” “Take him from the house!” A rope was produced, and flung, knot and noose over the prisoner, and five men dragged him to the corner post, and hung him.",

    "article-transcript": "Helena, Ark., May 16.—A story is told by some citizens of Friar’s Point which shows a terrible state of affairs in that village.⏎The report is that about ten days ago an old Chinaman was severely beaten by two or three citizens and ordered to leave town, which he started to do, going on the wharf-boat to wait for a boat.⏎The self-authorized vigilants were not satisfied at this, however, and went to the wharf, caught the Chinaman, threw him into the river, and on his failing to drown as quickly as they desired, shot him to death.⏎The perpetrators of the murder claim that the Chinaman assaulted a young girl, the daughter of one of the lynchers; but other citizens say he meant no harm to the girl, and did nothing to alarm her, only putting his hand on her face to attract her attention.⏎The names of the parties connected with the affair cannot be ascertained, but they are prominent citizens, and the body of the Chinaman has been found and some of his slayers arrested.⏎The town is said to be divided into two factions; one desiring to shield the criminals and the other endeavoring to have law enforced.",

During the year 1903 there were 8,796 murders and homicides in the United States. There were only 123 legal executions, 115 of which were for murders and homicides in 1902, and 7,852 persons, liquor 302, and quarrels brought about 4,952 deaths. There were 8,834 murders and homicides in 1902, and 7,852 in 1901. Suicides in 1903 numbered 8,597, an increase of 306 over 1902 and of 1,352 over 1901.⏎What is the remedy? Do people really believe in capital punishment? When inflicted, does it deter others from the commission of crime?⏎The Chicago Tribune prints statistics showing that 104 lynchings occurred in this country, as against 96 in the previous year. The increases were in Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana and Arkansas, which are the chief lynching States of the Union. Fifty-seven of the lynchings occurred in the four States, leaving but 47 to be assigned to 41 States and territories. Seventeen whites and one Chinaman were lynched during the year, and 86 negroes. The alleged crimes were as follows: Murder, 47; criminal assault, 11; attempted assault, 10; murderous assault, 7; unknown offenses, 5; race prejudice, 5; complicity in murder, 5; mistaken identity, 3; insults to whites, 2; making threats, 1; refusing to give information, 1.”⏎That is a showing as sanguinary as it is shameful. In a single year, 8,834 people murdered and 104 lynched! It is small wonder that foreigners ask sneeringly if the United States is a civilized country.⏎And the worst of it is that there is apparently no remedy for a condition so deplorable and so disgraceful. The lynching spirit seems to be growing rather than declining, and instances of provocation do not decrease.⏎Apparently nothing but the slow leaven of a higher civilization can be relied on to afford relief from the blood-horror shown by these figures.",

Cage, cashier of the Planters' Bank, reported to have been lynched Monday morning, were not killed or lynched, according to reports received here subsequently. The Chinaman after having been pursued by a posse all day crawled on his hands and knees back to town, and the negro, Yancey Dean, accused of having entered the home of the banker, has apparently eluded arrest.⏎At a mass meeting held here last night mob violence was deplored and the 1,500 people assembled registered their disapproval of blind tigers and took a strong stand for law enforcement. There has been an epidemic of burglaries here recently and this connected with the killing of Sunday night has aroused the ire of the law-abiding element.⏎After following the trail of the supposed murderer of Albert H. Cage, cashier of the Planters Bank, for about 10 hours, the hound of M. B. Brister came to a halt in the middle of a public road near the McWilliams plantation near the Mississippi River in the lower end of the county. They were taken off for a rest and put on the trail again about two hours later, and when they reached this point in the road they again came to a halt and were unable to find any further trail. The supposition is that the hunted man was picked up by a conveyance and succeeded in making his way to the river and crossed to the Arkansas side. The cane breaks and adjacent territory to where the dogs lost the trail is being thoroughly searched for some trace of the man.⏎Mr. Cage was interred Monday afternoon in Oak Ridge Cemetery with Masonic honors.

The woman’s jewelry was found on his person, and bloody garments and other incidents point to his guilt. He was immediately brought here and lodged in jail.⏎At 10 o'clock last night a mob of eighty men went to the jail, broke the lock, and in ten minutes Gow was swinging to the limb of a neighboring bull pine. The guard who had been placed in the jail made no resistance, and there was no noise or excitement. The murderer and his victim now lie side by side; an inquest will be held over both to-morrow.",

His room in the rear of his store was entered on the night of the 11th inst., and he was murdered and his body horribly mutilated. An attempt was then made to blow open the safe, which was unsuccessful. The tracks on the outside of the building showed that a Chinaman had done the deed.

These were taken out and summarily disposed of.⏎DRIVEN FROM THE MINES.⏎PANIC STRICKEN MONGOLS.⏎SEATTLE, W.T., Sept. 22.—The quarters of the Chinese workmen at the Black Diamond Mines were visited by a mob last night. They were armed with repeating rifles and each had a sack drawn over his head with holes cut for the mouth, nose, and eyes. They were thus completely disguised, and presented a fearful appearance. The Chinese fled in terror from their houses, which were then burned. These Chinamen had already been discharged from the mines, and expected to return to Seattle this morning.⏎There is much excitement over the Chinese question here. A convention to consist of delegates from all parts of the Puget Sound country has been called to meet here Sept. 28, to devise means of ridding the country of the Chinese. The feeling is intensified by the fact that the Federal authorities hardly make a pretext of stopping the Mongols from crossing the border into Washington Territory from British Columbia. The law which was made to protect the people from the influx of the Chinese is practically a dead letter, and in consequence of this the citizens take the law into their own hands with a view to protecting themselves.",

    "article-title": "The Chico Chinese Massacre",
    "article-transcript": "The recent massacre of Chinese at a camp near Chico has excited universal horror and indignation, and we are glad to see that the citizens of Chico have lost no time in expressing their sentiments in regard to the atrocious crime, and in combining to take active measures for the detection of the criminals.⏎Governor Irwin is said to have fixed a reward of five hundred dollars for the first conviction, and two hundred and fifty dollars for each subsequent conviction, of the murderers; and other rewards offered already raise the amount promised for the avengement of the crime to four thousand dollars.⏎So far this is well, but we submit that in a case of such enormity nothing should be left undone that can tend to make and emphasize the public detestation of the offense, and that the Governor should, if he had at his disposal for the purpose at all, offer a higher reward than he has done.⏎It is already placed beyond question that the murderers were white men.⏎The magistrate of Chico has received a threatening letter since the commission of the massacre, informing him that his life will be forfeited if he undertakes to hunt down the assassins.⏎This is proof that they not only disclaim any interest in or responsibility for the massacre of the Chinese by assassination, but have formed a reward themselves for the reward offered for their arrest.⏎They evidently possess some kind of organization, and who support one another in their infamous practices, and from the insolence and audacity of their proceedings since the massacre, menacing with death those who endeavor to discover the perpetrators, it is clear that half-measures will be of no use in dealing with them.⏎The fact that this is not the first attack upon Chinese in that county, but rather the culmination of a long list of less daring outrages, tends to show that there is some kind of local organization of assassins and murderers in that region.⏎Wherever they are, and whatever their ramifications, it is absolutely necessary, alike in the interest of law and order and for the good name of the State, that the scoundrels should be ferreted out and punished.⏎Nor will it be worth their while to indulge the error of supposing that they will be shielded by the sympathy of the people of California, or that because they call themselves white men and their victims were Chinese, there is any disposition to treat them with lenity.⏎They have committed a crime which, horrifies the lives of every one not to the outraged law, and every son of a citizen of California possesses sense enough to distinguish between right and wrong who is not prepared to indorse the views and express the sympathies of these and any other illegal and cowardly murderers.⏎We sincerely hope that the purpose and the energies of the people of Chico will not now end.⏎The crime is too atrocious to be wiped out without the blood of its authors being either put rifled if the first attempt to secure the criminals should fail.⏎The fame of all who reside in Chico and Butte county, and in a less direct manner the fair fame of all who call California their home, is involved in the administration of justice in a case of this kind.⏎A failure to hunt down the assassins would be regarded all over the country as a condonation of the crime.⏎It would be said that the murderers were not taken because the public sympathized with them, and did not care enough about the lives of Chinamen to desire that the law should be vindicated.⏎More than this, the escape of these villains would react most disastrously upon public sentiment throughout the East, and at Washington.⏎All the efforts of the people of the Pacific Coast to secure limitation of Chinese immigration must be impotent so long as American brutality and barbarism are suffered to display themselves in this hideous fashion.⏎It is impossible to appeal to Congress for “protection” against Chinese competition, while dastardly white assassins are doing their best to convince the world that Mongolian or any other race of civilization must be preferable to that illustrated by these atrocious outrages.⏎If, indeed, there are any persons in California so misguided as to imagine that crimes like the Chico massacre can be palliated, or who secretly sympathize with the wretches who perpetrated them, or who excuse such an universal sympathy for law and order, and co-operate to follow and punish them.⏎Nor is there any class of Chinese which is not a more desirable element in a civilized community than these murderous villains.⏎If a choice had to be made between them and the Chinamen, all intelligent and law-abiding persons would unquestionably prefer the latter.⏎It is evidently time that this should be clearly understood, and that the worthless murderers who apparently think they are appealing to popular sympathy and approval in slaughtering better men than themselves, be comprehended how utterly and—essentially they are loathed and repudiated by the white race of California.⏎The press of this State has for years stood by the people in their efforts to procure such Congressional action upon the Chinese question as they desired.⏎That attitude continues; but now the people must stand by the press in insisting that these massacres and outrages shall be effectually avenged.⏎The time for appeals to the reason of the brutishly-inclined has passed, and it has become necessary to speak to them in stern language which the lowest grade of intelligence alone fit to be comprehended.⏎California cannot afford to be made a by-word throughout the civilized world, because of the crimes of a few ruffians.⏎She must rise and crush the vermin, and vindicate law and order.",

    "article-transcript": "On Tuesday evening last two intoxicated men visited the residence of Chas. Helwig, near Rogers’s ranch, and demanded some wine. Mr. Helwig is a one-armed man. He saw that the men had more liquor than they ought to have, and refused them the wine.⏎They turned upon Helwig and beat him most unmercifully, and then went out into the yard and set fire to his fence. The fire was getting under a good headway, when Louis Seibert and others went over and extinguished it.⏎The men were unknown to Mr. Helwig, but we hope they will be found out and severely punished for the dastardly outrage.—Nevada Transcript.⏎If the Sheriff of Nevada county allows these ruffians to escape, he should be held to strict accountability. A suitable sum should be immediately offered as a reward for their apprehension. We wonder at the supineness of our contemporary in not suggesting it.⏎There is altogether too much of these incendiary, cut-throat outrages going on throughout the State, and we hear of no adequate punishments being inflicted. We are getting to be as bandit-ridden a community as there is in the civilized world.⏎Last week an incendiary fire was started near Ophir. Sunday before last, we had a large portion of this town burned in the same way.⏎Our exchanges from all parts of the State tell us from time to time of similar acts of ruffianism. Every few days we read of something of the kind.⏎The incendiary mania received its impetus dating from the time of the Trout Creek burning and murders near Truckee less than two years ago. Arrests followed, but the parties charged with the crime were acquitted.⏎This was followed by the incendiary burning of the Chinese quarters at Antioch, then the Chico burning and massacre, the sacking of the washhouses in San Francisco and elsewhere, in which Chinese were uniformly the sufferers.⏎These atrocious crimes, for the most part, went unpunished. In the Chico case, the assassins were sent to San Quentin nominally for twenty or twenty-five years.⏎But does any one suppose those fiends will serve out their terms? The experience of the past does not lead any observant person to suppose so.⏎Pardoning by the Governor has been too frequent to justify the belief.⏎We fear there is a misguided sentiment existing in the minds of many tending to the condonement of offenses against the Chinese.⏎It is needless to refer to the verdict of the Chico jury in support of this assumption; it is well known.⏎This is a reluctance on the part of juries serve indirectly as an encouragement to the lawless classes, who, in their unreasoning hate for the Chinese individuality, will not hesitate when opportunity offers to burn them alive in their cabins.⏎We hear of white men’s property being burned with that of the Chinese—as at Walnut Grove last week.⏎Self-preservation will, ere long, compel the stamping out of these ruffianly crimes, and that can be done only by vigorous measures.⏎We do not mean lynching. That is not to be thought of. If citizens would only do in a judicial and legal capacity what many do in an illegal manner, viz.: hang these assassins, imprison for long terms at hard labor those incendiaries, there would be no occasion for lynching.",

    "article-title": "A Chicago View of Kearneyism",
    "article-transcript": "The press of the country is discussing California Communism quite generally, and as might be expected, the accounts of Kearneyism which find their way abroad lose nothing in the process of transmission. Exaggeration and sensationalism lend their aid to magnify and make the picture more lurid, and though the actual facts are bad enough, the distortion of them which is becoming common produces results calculated to react very injuriously upon the reputation of this State. The Chicago Tribune publishes a letter from California on this subject, and accompanies it with an editorial article in which some curious statements are made. Thus we find it asserted that Kearneyism “has carried on its operations with so high a hand, fulminated its threats so openly, and increased so rapidly, that the press, the Courts, and authorities of San Francisco have been living under a reign of terrorism. The press has been afraid to denounce the scoundrels lest the offices might be mobbed. The authorities have not dared to break up the incendiary meetings or arrest the leaders. The Courts have been paralyzed, and the officers of the law have hidden themselves away whenever the Kearneyites have made their appearance.” It is further stated that at a recent meeting “Kearney advocated the lynching of a State Senator who had dared to denounce the ruffianism of the so-called ‘Workingmen’s Party’ of California. He not only urged his dupes to exterminate the Chinese, but to drive the Americans out also, and, if any resistance were made, to fire the city. Under his instructions the members of his party have armed themselves, and are seen upon the streets with pistols and shotguns. The people of the city are terrorized. The authorities not only do not break up these incendiary meetings, but they are afraid to make any preparations to resist the violence that is threatened. Almost the result is that business men are seriously talking of closing up and removing elsewhere, and insurance companies are raising their rates in anticipation of a fire that will involve widespread destruction.”⏎It will be noted that while there is some exaggeration in this, a substratum of fact for almost every statement notoriously exists, and that the situation is of a kind to render very difficult a very broad separation of the false from the true. It is conspicuously apparent that Kearneyism has been permitted to do with impunity almost everything that a victorious mob of Communists could do. It has been allowed to spend months in open preparation for a programme of violence which meantime it has preached undisguisedly. It has been allowed to threaten San Francisco with the fate of Moscow. It has been allowed to fulminate open menaces against the lives of citizens. It has been allowed to defy all authority, and to educate the dangerous classes to a contempt for law and order. If, under the circumstances, the world reaches the conclusion that San Francisco is suffering under a reign of terror, we think the supposition not merely natural but justifiable. It is also evident that the continuance of such a state of things must lead to the most serious consequences—i.e., that law-abiding men will refuse to live in a city which affords so little protection to its inhabitants, and will close out their business and go away. This is one of the obvious effects of Kearneyism which a very large number of people are only just now realizing home—to the San Francisco people with disagreeable force.",

    "article-transcript": "How It is Viewed by a Leading Paper at the East.⏎From the Chicago Tribune.⏎CALIFORNIA COMMUNISM.⏎San Francisco and many other of the principal cities of California are at present suffering from one of the worst phases of Communism that has ever afflicted any part of the United States. We print elsewhere a letter from San Francisco that gives some details of the growth and operations of this organization, known as the “Kearney party.” It had its origin in hostility to the Chinese. Its membership is made up of Irish, Germans, French, and Bohemians. It has extended its hostilities to Americans as well as Chinese. It claims to defend the rights of labor, as do Communists everywhere; in reality, it has a hand against all society, and its objects are incendiarism, violence, mob-rule, and plunder. It has carried on its operations with so high a hand, fulminated its threats so openly, and increased so rapidly, that the Press, the Courts, the authorities of San Francisco, have been living under a reign of terrorism. The Press has been afraid to denounce the scoundrels lest the offices might be mobbed. The authorities have not dared to break up the incendiary meetings or arrest the leaders. The Courts have been paralyzed, and the officers of the law have hidden themselves away whenever the Kearneyites have made their appearance. How far they have succeeded in defying the law-abiding sentiment of the community, and how boldly and unblushingly they have issued their pronunciamentos and defied the law, may be inferred from the proceedings of the meeting, which are printed in the letter to which we have referred, and which the San Francisco papers were afraid to publish or comment upon, for fear of mob violence. At this meeting, Kearney, the leading Communist, advocated the lynching of a State Senator who had dared to denounce the ruffianism of the so-called “Workingmen’s Party” of California. He not only urged his dupes to exterminate the Chinese, but to drive the Americans out also, and, if any resistance were made, to fire the city. Under his instructions the members of his party have armed themselves, and are seen upon the streets with pistols and shot-guns. The people of the city are terrorized. The authorities not only do not break up these incendiary meetings, but they are afraid to make any preparations to resist the violence that is threatened. The result is that business men are seriously talking of closing up and removing elsewhere, and insurance companies are raising their rates in anticipation of a fire that will involve widespread destruction.⏎There was a time when the San Francisco Vigilance Committee would have promptly suppressed Kearney and his mob. Perhaps the spirit of vigilance is not altogether dead yet, and the Committee, when the time comes, may rouse itself and do its work over again with the same power and promptness that made it a terror to thieves and incendiaries years ago. The mistake made by the city authorities was in allowing this movement to gain such headway. It should have been suppressed at the very outset. Kearney should have been sent to the State Prison before this time, and that would have been the end of his rabble of foreign ruffians, who are now defying the law and threatening the lives and property of citizens of San Francisco, because they have had the misfortune to be born of the country and of American parents. The way to suppress Communism is to suppress its leaders and thereby prevent it from spreading. When it is allowed to gather such a head that it can set the law at defiance and organize its schemes of incendiarism and plunder, then it involves serious loss of life and bloodshed.

Discovery of a Celestial Sheepherder Hanging in His Cabin.⏎A couple of Chinamen arrived in the city yesterday with the information that they had discovered a compatriot hanging by the neck in a cabin occupied by him about three miles south of Silver Bow. The news was carried to Priest Whitford, who, after a tedious search for the men, found them in Climbing and obtained all the information they had to impart in regard to the affair. They said that the defunct Chinaman was a shepherd, employed by Tom Mills, and he there days ago returned up mining. His continued absence made them uneasy, they said, and yesterday morning they repaired to his cabin, where they found him hanging from one of the rafters. He had been dead about three days, they thought, and after satisfying themselves that he was beyond all certainty they came to the city and told his brother, who is employed as a cook in one of the Main‑street restaurants, of the incident. They did not know whether the deceased had committed suicide or had been murdered, and it was with extreme difficulty that the Coroner obtained from them the story given above.⏎The brother was interviewed last night, and seemed to be but little troubled by the news he had received. He told the Coroner that he knew all about deceased’s temper and his animosity. He knew all about him, and he is alive all right. “The Coroner inquired if the deceased had committed suicide, but the decussal cook refused to throw any light on the mystery. ‘I am all right’ was all he would say.”⏎The Coroner and the three Chinamen will depart this morning for the cabin in which the body was found, where a thorough investigation of the man’s death will be made. The celestial sheep‑herder seems to vacillate between suicide and murder.",

His head was crushed in with clubs. Attempts to drive him out of the camp had failed. About two weeks ago Ed Moore protected the Chinaman, standing off his enemies with a Winchester.

William Reilly was shot and instantly killed by Thomas F. Allen. The trouble was over the marriage of the son of Allen to a daughter of Reilly. Allen went down town this morning and as he entered the postoffice he noticed Reilly standing outside. As he came out Reilly drew a pistol, saying: “Tom Allen, defend yourself.” Mr. Armstrong, a bystander, seized Reilly, but Reilly fired and the ball struck Allen. Meanwhile Allen had drawn his pistol and remarked: “You see how it is; let him loose.” Before Reilly could again fire Allen had fired two shots, the first giving mild and wounding Allen’s little boy who sat in a buggy in the street. The second shot struck Reilly in the forehead and drew a third shot. A fourth shot from Allen’s pistol took effect in the left lung. Mr. Allen immediately surrendered to the sheriff and went to jail.",

The Chinaman merely arose to his feet and commenced sawing wood again. Shortly afterward Braden, with several others, passed the place again, when he made another lunge at the Chinaman, when the latter swung his saw around his head and bit Braden with it. Braden bled very freely from the wound, which was about four inches long and in his deep. Hopes were entertained of his recovery, as no large vein had been severed. Today, however, Braden died from injury, as his lower limbs had been paralyzed by the blow, which had affected the spinal cord. Threats are uttered against the residents of Chinatown, but the authorities have put on fifty extra police to keep order the hooligans and the mob to-night, which, it is feared, will lynch the Mongolian murderer and his friends.

    "article-transcript": "Two Men and a Woman Murderously Assaulted by Chinese Robbers at Sargent’s Rancho, California—A Cold‑Blooded Affair. Pursuit and Identification of the Murderers—Citizens Greatly Excited, and are Barely Prevented from Lynching the Entire Chinese Population.⏎SAN FRANCISCO, September 16.—Yesterday afternoon people passing near Sargent’s ranch, about two miles from Rocklin, Placer county, heard several pistol shots, and as they approached the house two men ran away, scaling the fence. On entering the building the body of Mrs. Oder, who with her husband and Sargent occupied the premises, was found on the floor. She had been shot twice and her head split with an ax. An alarm was given, and the constables and citizens began a search. About fifty yards from the house the body of Mr. Oder was found. He had received three pistol shots. The party then followed the trail of the men who were seen to jump the fence. The tracks showed that they were made by Chinese shoes. After crossing a ravine three‑quarters of a mile from the house, and in a clump of willows, they found Sargent, bleeding from wounds in the head and body. He was conscious, and stated that two Chinamen had called at the house shortly after noon and desired to purchase certain mining claims of him. He accompanied them to the claim, and while returning in the body and head, and left him for dead. He said the assassins were from Peuryn, a neighboring village, one being Cook. In Grant’s boarding house, near the Peuryn quarries, he had received one hundred and twenty dollars from other Chinamen a few days before on a mining claim, which was in his trunk at the house, and presumed the murders were committed to obtain the money. The party followed the tracks of the murderers to a Chinese cabin near by, where they arrested three Chinamen, one of whom was in bed but perspiring freely as though he had been running. Several other Chinamen living near by were arrested, and one who was much frightened volunteered the information that Ah‑Sam and Ah‑Jim had murdered Sargent, but then stopped and would say no more. One of the prisoners had one hundred and twenty dollars in his possession. It was discovered that the trunk in which Sargent had deposited his money had been cut open and the money taken.⏎SARGENT DIED THIS MORNING. Hundreds of citizens viewed the body this morning. Great excitement prevailed during the night, and had the evidence against the prisoners been deemed conclusive, they would doubtless have been lynched at once. The cook of Grant’s boarding‑house could not be found, though the country and towns for miles around were scoured. This morning a meeting of citizens was held at Rocklin, and all the Chinamen were notified to leave town before six o’clock this evening. By four o’clock the last squad, burdened with their baggage, filed out of town, including those employed by the railroad company, only the prisoners remaining. They were in no way molested. At six o’clock in the afternoon the citizens marched to the Chinese quarters and DEMOLISHED ALL THE BUILDINGS, TWENTY‑FIVE IN NUMBER, including one store, the stock of which had been removed by the owner. A fire broke out during the demolition, from the stove remaining in one house, but was extinguished by the railroad employes with an engine. At the inquest held to‑day the facts developed led the sheriff to believe that four of the Chinese were implicated in the murder, and it was ordered that they be removed to the county jail at Auburn. A crowd collected when they boarded the train, and the murmurs of the throng broke out with the exclamation: “Have at them; hang them.” A rush was made for the door of the car, but the sheriff and deputies seized it, and only for a few shots by pistols by the officers and conductors of the train, the purposes of the crowd would have been accomplished. The crowd was finally forced back and the train pulled out from the station, followed by the citizens.⏎THE YELLS OF THE THRONG. The moderation displayed by the citizens, with the exception of the above incident, is partly attributable to the fact that through the day, by common consent, all saloon‑keepers closed up their places; otherwise serious consequences would undoubtedly have ensued. The coroner’s jury found the murder of Sargent committed by Ah‑Sam, Ah‑Jim and another Chinaman, name unknown; Sargent having subsequently mentioned their names before he died. In the cases of Oder and his wife the jury failed to fix the responsibility. The remaining prisoners were all allowed to leave, there being no evidence against them. About eight o’clock this evening the buildings of the Chinese garden, about a mile from Rocklin, were burned. It is positively denied that the whites set them on fire, and possibly the Chinese abandoned and burned them. Sargent was an old and respected resident. Oder was a Bavarian. His wife has relatives in Trenton, New Jersey.⏎MORE MURDERS. A Rockland dispatch, this morning, says a body of a man was found in the vineyard near Sargent’s house, and shortly before noon the body of a boy, about eight years old, was found in the same vineyard, both murdered by pistol shots. Intense excitement prevails, and all the Chinamen are being driven from that part of the country.",

The amount appropriated by the bill for that purpose is $150,000.⏎In the senate Saturday Ingalls’ resolution was laid before the senate calling on the secretary of the interior for information as to the authority for the issuance of the recent order of the commissioner of the general land office suspending the receip* of applications for public lands under the pre-emptory timber culture and desert land acts. Walthall said soon after the order was issued the secretary of the interior doubled its legal authority without reference to precedents and had determined to revoke it. On Friday an hour or more before the senate met, and two or three hours before the offering of the Ingalls resolution, he (Walthall) saw and read the original draft of the order revoking it, and in a conversation with the secretary of the interior on the subject, had learned from the secretary that he had grave doubts as to the legality of the order, and had determined on the very day of its issue to revoke it.⏎During the discussion on the above the following colloquy took place between Ingalls and Cockrell: Cockrell—Why could not the senator answer a proper question at once? Ingalls—The senator from Missouri is incapable of asking a polite question of any body. That is the reason. Cockrell—And the senator from Kansas is incapable of answering a gentleman. Ingalls—I never shall have an opportunity of answering a gentleman whenever the senator from Missouri interrogates me. The chair urged the senators to keep order. Edmunds (sotto voce)—That is unparliamentary. Ingalls (also sotto voce)—You say it is. The house Saturday passed the senate bill for the erection of a public building at Zanesville, Ohio, with an amendment reducing the appropriation from $150,000 to $100,000; also the senate bill appropriating $100,000 for the erection of a public building at Sioux City, Iowa.⏎Atkinson of Pennsylvania, from the committee on estimates, reported bill amending section 4587, calendarized. [The change proposed will give to an inventor a patent for seventeen years if his application for a patent is filed in this country before a patent is granted in a foreign country. The present law provides that if an invention is first patented in a foreign country, an American patent subsequently issued for the same invention shall expire with the foreign patent.]⏎A discussion then arose as to the procedure of business. Holman of Indiana desiring to call up appropriation bills, Throckmorton of Texas and Irish of Georgia advocating the claims of the committee on Pacific railroads and O’Neill desiring that the day should be assigned to the consideration of bill relating to labor. The house rejected motions to go into committee on the whole on legislative appropriation and labor bills, and by a vote of 123 to 41 took up for consideration the Pacific railroad extension bill. It was agreed that the previous question should be considered as ordered at 4 o’clock unless the debate should exhaust itself at an earlier hour.",

    "article-transcript": "HE MEETS HIS DEATH LIKE A CRAVEN COWARD.⏎Irate Citizens Show Their Disapproval of a Jury’s Recommendation to Mercy by Lynching the Celestial—A Story of the Crime Which Cost Him His Life.⏎CHICAGO, July 11.—A special dispatch from Colusa, Cal., printed here says: At about 12:30 o’clock yesterday morning Hong Di (Chinese), the domestic who murdered Mrs. Billiou at St. John sometime ago, was taken from jail and hanged by a mob. The murderer had been on trial for several days and a verdict of guilty was rendered Saturday, the jury fixing the punishment at imprisonment for life. Mrs. Billiou, her two daughters and William Weaver, the head servant man, were sitting at supper when the door of the dining‑room was thrown open by Hong Di, the cook, who leveled a Winchester rifle at Weaver and shot him through the shoulder.⏎KILLED INSTANTLY. He fell on the floor and a second shot went through Mrs. Billiou’s head, killing her instantly. Both daughters fled to an adjoining room and escaped uninjured. The Chinaman fled and Weaver managed to get on his feet and locked the door. No trace of the murderer could be seen for nearly a week, when he was found on the bank of the Sacramento river, nearly starved to death. The circumstances of the assassination were still fresh in the mind of every one, and on hearing the verdict the crowd became exasperated. The Judge refused to accept the decision of the jury, and a wild scene at once began.⏎EVERY MAN ARMED. Almost every man present was armed, and in an instant 100 pistols were drawn amid cries of “Lynch him!” The Sheriff jumped to his feet and quieted the crowd long enough to say that while he disapproved of the verdict, he hoped no blood would be shed in court. The crowd left the court room and the prisoner was removed to the jail. Soon efforts were being made by the crowd to lynch the prisoner, and while the Sheriff and his charge were inside a large and determined mob was forming outside the jail. All day long crowds kept on the street, but no effort was made to get at the prisoner until near midnight. At midnight the town was alive with strangers from surrounding places, including the captain of a steamer and twenty of his crew.⏎ATTACKING THE JAIL. Citizens were posted at all avenues of escape, and about 12:30 o’clock a break was made for the jail. Guards had been posted by the Sheriff, but as they were in sympathy with those on the outside but little resistance was made. In a few moments the assassin was in the avengers’ hands. Weaver, the man whom he had shot first, was present, rope in hand. The prisoner was at once dragged out and conveyed to a bridge, shrieking and screaming in terror. His cries were addressed to deaf ears, however. The rope was put around his neck. Despite his desperate struggle half a dozen men raised him in their arms and he was tossed over the parapet. The wretched being was probably half dead when thrown over. He struggled feebly a few minutes and then the assassin of Mrs. Billiou swung quietly. Shortly afterward the body was cut down by order of the Sheriff and carried to the jail.",

He brings a mass of affidavits which show that previous story did not tell half the horrors of this monstrous crime against a poor defenseless Chinaman, who was first robbed by white lawyers and then abandoned to the vengeance of the Indians by the Sheriff and his officers.⏎It will be remembered that Ah Quong Tir was a Chinese merchant who was accused of killing an Indian named Poker Piute, cutting the body up and throwing it in the river. When arrested two lawyers pretended to get a confession from him that he killed the Indian in self‑defense, but on the trial the Chinaman denied he had made any such confession, and on the evidence produced he was promptly acquitted.⏎FELL AMONG PHILISTINES. His lawyers, Parker & Murphy, took all the Chinaman’s stock of goods for their fee, although he had refused to give them a bill of sale which they asked for. He agreed to pay them $1,000 if they cleared him, but his goods were worth between $4,000 and $5,000. After his death the claims of the two lawyers were settled for $500 by representatives of the Chinaman’s creditors, but many of the goods had been sold at low prices, and the remainder were seized by the public administrator.⏎When the Walker River Indians came into town and threatened to lynch the Chinaman, the Sheriff swore in six deputies and guarded the jail, but on the day of the trial, as soon as he had delivered the Chinaman at the Court House, he left the prisoner unprotected, although the street was full of excited Indians clamoring for his blood.⏎Affidavits have been presented that Chairman Hunnewell, of the Supervisors, and a merchant named Hughes advised the Indians just before the trial to kill the Chinaman, as it would save the county the costs of the trial. Two other white men encouraged Indians to seize the prisoner and butcher him, and reputable witnesses will swear to this.⏎NO NEED OF A PANIC. A claim was made that citizens were terrorized by the armed Indians who threatened to sack the town unless the Chinaman was delivered to them. The real facts are that only seven of the Indians were armed, three with Winchesters and four with pistols, and one determined white man with a revolver could have stood off the whole mob.⏎The butchery of the Chinaman was done by the government Indian police from Walker River Reservation, and as described by the woman who saw it through field glasses, was very horrible. The Indians hacked off the arms and legs of the Chinaman while living. Then they disemboweled him and cut off his head, which they used as a football, flinging the game with the ghastly head in the sage brush. The Chinese Consul General is determined to press the case and demand that those concerned in the outrage be punished.",

    "article-transcript": "[Summarized] Second Day’s Examination.⏎Examination for prosecution continued. Richard Rivers, sworn: I know of a riot in Los Angeles on the 24th of Oct.; it commenced in front of Caswell’s store; know where Coroner Hook is; the riot was against the Chinese; they occupied the Coronel building; saw some 2 or 3 hundred come between 8 and 10 o’clock; saw shouting, shooting, shooting; at the Chinese’s head; saw the mob make threatening expressions; the mob was threatening in appearance; did not see Chinamen taken from the building; saw a Chinaman hanged; on the gateway of the place now occupied by Mr. Heber; do not know who he was hanged by; Harris and myself and another man had a Chinaman in custody; he was taken away from us and hanged; arrested the Chinaman opposite Meyer’s store on Los Angeles Street; the Chinaman was taken from us in front of Burdick’s store; arrested him in front of Coronel building; a crowd in front of the building followed us; heard them shout “hang him, shoot him;” there were many of those who followed who assisted in taking him away; saw them taking the Chinaman to jail; am an officer; they took the Chinaman up Temple Street and hanged him; remained there about two minutes; it was about half past seven; returned to the corner of Caswell’s store; heard shooting; saw them throwing fire-balls into the house.⏎When asked whether he saw any violence demonstrated against the buildings opposite the Coronel, Rivers conceded only that he witnessed shots fired, fire-balls tossed, and the two-minute lynching itself—no grand conflagration, no other Chinese seized.⏎Emile Harris, sworn in the afternoon session, knew Gene Tong “both alive at the Coroner’s office about six o’clock that evening and dead in the jail yard the next morning.”  “I saw him alive at the Coroner’s … next time I saw him he was in the jail yard, dead; Coroner was holding inquest; he saw him first in the wagon that brought him to town; he died from his injuries; know where the remains are; was examined by Dr. Mason, Coroner’s physician.”  On cross-examination, Harris admitted he did not witness the hanging itself and could not say who removed the body from the scaffold before nine o’clock.⏎James Reed, another bystander, testified that he “was at Caswell’s corner when the mob broke for the jail; saw men throwing fire-balls; saw them tearing up paving flags; knew the Coroner; heard Gene Tong called out by name; saw only one Chinaman; saw him hanging from a scaffold in front of Scovel’s; was there in the evening; saw the body until about nine o’clock, when it was removed.”  Under cross-examination Reed likewise could offer no account of the body’s final disposition.⏎Defense counsel strove to undermine each recollection—questioning precise times, distances to distant corners (Dr. Gehlo’s, Laventhal’s, Tombstone’s corral), and whether any building was actually set aflame.  Yet even under rigorous scrutiny, every witness agreed on the mob’s size (200–300 men), its armaments (clubs, pistols, fire-balls), and the central fact that Gene Tong was snatched from the Coronel corral, dragged up Temple Street, strung to a rope, and left hanging in full view of the crowd for nearly two minutes.⏎By day’s end, the courtroom had mapped out the chronology of horror: rioters assembling near Caswell’s at about eight o’clock, the captive laborer hauled through the streets, his death-sentence carried out at half-past seven, and his remains held aloft until after dark.  As the judge adjourned until ten the next morning, the district attorney announced his intention to call officers, bystanders, and perhaps even confessed participants to fill in the hours between the lynching and the body’s final disappearance—and to secure convictions for murder.",

The Murderer’s Run For Life—The Obstinate Juror Weeps and Gets Slapped—The Murderer Secretly Removed From the Jail.⏎FULL ASSOCIATED PRESS AND THE MERCURY’S SPECIAL DISPATCHES.⏎COLUSA, July 10.—The jury in the case of Hong Di agreed on a verdict at 1 o’clock this morning. The judge was notified and refused to receive it till later in the day. When the verdict was opened it proved to be for murder in the first degree, fixing the penalty at imprisonment for life. An attempt to lynch Hong Di in the court‐room was repulsed by the sheriff and posse.⏎ASSISTANCE ASKED.⏎SACRAMENTO, July 10.—About noon to‐day the following dispatch was received here:⏎COLUSA, July 10.—To Governor Bartlett: Just received a verdict of murder in the first degree in the Hong Di case, and imprisonment for life. Bold attempt to take him from the Court‐room. A mob is now surrounding the jail. The sheriff will be unable to protect him. Must have assistance immediately.⏎W. L. BENVILLE, Sheriff.⏎E. A. BRIDGEFORD, Superior Judge.⏎The governor is at Alameda and Adjutant‐General Cosby is with him.⏎Secretary Markley forwarded the dispatch to Bartlett, who immediately replied to turn the matter over to the Adjutant‐General’s office. Colonel Perrie Keenan at once sent the following telegrams, first at 4 o’clock:⏎Colonel Grayson, Colusa: Take command of the Colusa Guard, and report to the sheriff. By order of the governor.⏎GEORGE B. COSBY, Adjutant‐General.⏎A telegram was also sent to General J. W. B. Montgomery, commanding the Chico Guard, Chico, advising him to instruct Colonel Grayson to report to the sheriff of Colusa county. Private Secretary Markley telegraphed General Beville to call upon General Montgomery if he wanted more assistance, and the Chico Guard would go to his aid.⏎THE PLAN OF ACTION.⏎COLUSA, July 10.—Last night it was planned by the people that should the verdict not be in their favor the first degree, to take the prisoner away from the officers and hang him to the bridge, a passage way from the court‐house to the jail.⏎PROTECTING THE PRISONER.⏎It was nearly nine this morning when the court was assembled and the jury gave in their verdict. The sheriff’s posse had taken the precaution to put the prisoner behind his attorney’s desk, inside the bar that they could better protect him. The audience listened with breathless silence to the verdict.⏎“IT IS NOT SATISFACTORY.”⏎After the verdict was read Mr. Billiou, brother of Joseph Billiou, addressed the court saying: “If your honor please, the verdict is not satisfactory.”⏎This caused a moment’s delay on investigation of which forenoon the sheriff.⏎THE MOB SETS FORWARD.⏎They immediately surrounded the Chinaman. As the mob came forward, Judge Bridgeford arose and sternly said: “We must have order,” which was immediately followed by Sheriff Benville demanding the crowd to clear the courtroom. W. L. Greeu at this point fearing the shedding of blood, addressed the mob and said: “THE VERDICT IS AN OUTRAGE.”⏎“The verdict of this jury is an outrage upon the people of California and it is without parallel in our history. Yet these officers are sworn to perform their duty which they must do.”⏎Then a number of citizens undertook to quiet the leaders and to get them out of the Court‐room. Court‐House was finally cleared and Hong Di taken to the bridge. The jail door at the further end of the bridge was opened and the criminal told to run for his life. He needed no second bidding but glided with lightning‐like rapidity into the jail. Persons below intended to shoot him as he crossed the bridge but he was too quick for them. A large number of additional Deputy Sheriffs were at once sworn in and put on guard to protect the jail.⏎The jail is strongly built of brick with steel cells and it would be a futile effort to attempt violence thereon. The mob saw this and made no efforts in that direction. The opportunity for taking the prisoner has passed.⏎This evening the high excitement of the morning had subsided to a considerable degree.⏎GREAT INDIGNATION.⏎The indignation over the verdict of the jury after so plain a charge from the court and after such clear evidence of the guilt of the prisoner is without bounds. Denunciations of the jury are universal.⏎The jury until a late hour last night stood ten for murder in the first degree, one for manslaughter and, one for acquittal. At last they compromised on a sentence for life.⏎A HANGMAN’S NOOSE.⏎At the time of the verdict being rendered by the jury parties fastened a rope to the bridge between the Court‐House and jail with a hangman’s noose at the end in readiness for the criminal, providing he would have been secured by the mob. After Hong Di had gained the jail, one of the leading spirits of the mob threw the rope, still attached to the bridge, along the railroad, where it still swings.⏎JURYMAN CRIES WEEPS.⏎Juryman Gay went home on the noon train, as did the Billious. On the train a discussion was engaged in between Billiou and Gay, and Gay was convinced that he was in error in his action on the jury, as he was the one who favored leniency. As the train stopped at Colusa Junction he was regretting his action and began to cry.",

    "article-transcript": "Hanged by an Infuriated Mob in Barbarous Colusa. ⏎Shocking Lawlessness on the Part of the Populace—A Case for Investigation. ⏎COLUSA, July 10.—The jury in the Hong Di case brought in a verdict of murder in the first degree, fixing the penalty at imprisonment for life. There was an exciting scene in the court‐room when the verdict was announced, the Judge being obliged to place his hand on his pistol to protect himself. The Court‐house was finally cleared and Hong Di taken to the bridge leading to the jail. The jail door at the further end of the bridge was opened and the criminal told to run for his life. He needed no second bidding, but glided with lightning rapidity into the jail. Persons below intended to shoot him as he crossed the bridge, but he was too quick for them. ⏎HONG DI HANGED.⏎A mob was formed which finally captured the jail and took the prisoner out and hanged him. The following account of the affair is told by an Associated Press dispatch: A mob of 150 men attacked the jail at 12:10 this morning. They entered the jail, surrounded Sheriff Beville and demanded Hong Di. ⏎FINDING THE PRISONER.⏎The doors of the Sheriff’s office were closed and search was begun for the prisoner. In the bed‐room a trap‐door was found and food and Chinese shoes were at once discovered. Hong Di was immediately found in this cellar and was brought forth. He was greeted by scores of excited voices and a hundred puffs, the barrels of which gleamed in the moonlight. The Chinaman was taken a little over a block to the west of the jail, where a stop was made at Tim Sullivan’s livery stable and a rope procured, which was tied by a hangman’s knot around Hong Di’s neck. ⏎WEAVER QUESTIONS THE DOOMED.⏎A buggy was in waiting, and as the mob proceeded from this point the buggy followed. They proceeded through Chinatown, which was as quiet as the grave. Weaver was in the crowd which followed and came forward with considerable excitement. ⏎“Did I not give you a razor and many other things?” asked Weaver, in a tone of surprised passion. ⏎“Yes,” said the Chinaman, as though he were repeating a lesson he had learned by rote. ⏎“What did you shoot me for then?” ⏎Without pause or emotion to give the Chinaman time to reply, then he asked sharply, “What did you shoot Mrs. Billiou for?” ⏎The wretched convict stammered a few unintelligible words and then gasped out: “I was drunk with whiskey.” ⏎Weaver then said: “What did you tell Mrs. Billiou for, that when you threw some clothes on the floor and she said ‘Hong, shall I whip you for that,’ and you told her if she did you would kill her?” ⏎Promptly Hong replied: “I never said it.” ⏎NO ACCOMPLICE. ⏎“Who helped you to kill Mrs. Billiou? Did you tell any one beforehand what you were going to do?” ⏎The terror-stricken Chinaman replied: “No one.” ⏎“Did you tell Mrs. Billiou that J. H. Coster was going to be killed?” ⏎“No,” was the answer; “I never said that.” ⏎The Mongol looked a moment at the rope, set faces of the crowd, and the rifles which gleamed in the moonlight. ⏎The captain of the vigilantes now stepped forward and demanded room in order to swing the rope. When the leader saw that he had the attention of the crowd, he said: “Now, gentlemen, the rope goes up, but don’t shoot until I give the order.” ⏎THE LAW OUTRAGED.⏎There was a quick, strong pull, and the body of Hong Di swung in the air. As his feet cleared the ground he threw his hands up and clung with desperate grip to the rope just above his head. He hung in this way for several moments, his face showing the terrible fear that possessed him; but his weak arms soon relaxed, his hands fell and he remained hanging, swinging slowly from side to side. ⏎Several excited men made attempts to fire bullets into the body of the murderer, but they were prevented from accomplishing that purpose. After hanging about seven minutes he was lowered and calls were made for a doctor. Dr. Gray stepped forward and said that his heart was still beating. He was again hailed up and allowed to hang for ten minutes longer. ⏎CHEERS FOR THE LAW-BREAKERS.⏎Meanwhile three cheers and a tiger were given for Weaver. Groans continued were given for the jury, and several protests were uttered in favor of the guilty were enthusiastically received, but the material was lacking, and it was suggested that he had already been whipped by a woman, and that was glory enough for one day. ⏎Soon after he was fired until the captain ordered it. When the Chinaman was suspended three cheers for W. T. Beville, the Sheriff, were proposed for the faithful performance of his official duty and were responded to by the representative men of not only the town, but the county also. ⏎THE CORONER’S JURY.⏎A verdict that, in effect, the jury should also have been hanged. ⏎Special to the Mail⏎SACRAMENTO, July 14.—A Colusa special to the Bee says: Colusa went wild with joy after the lynching. The jury were hanged and burned in effigy, and crowds paraded the streets singing and cheering. There is but one feeling in the community this morning, and that is of unqualified approval of the act and universal condemnation of the jury. The Coroner’s jury this morning found that Hong Di came to his death by hanging at the hands of unknown men, and that the deed was brought about without the verdict of the jury brought in yesterday, which outraged the memory of a Christian woman; which prostituted law and savored of perjury. The Coroner’s jury condemns the system of trial by jury as lacking in moral elements. The verdict is the strongest ever returned in this county and exalts universal adulation.",

S. Kendall, M. D., to the place, to inquire into the cause of the death. On arriving at the place, at three o'clock P. M., about one-eighth of a mile north of Prairie City, they found a Chinaman suspended by the neck from the limb of an oak tree, with his feet about two feet from the ground. He was taken down and removed to Dresser's saloon in Prairie City, when an inquest was held before the following named jurors: W. B. Lawler, Edward Cady, W. Doran, Henry Keefe, Peter Willson, Unas Bitzer, John Holser, Patrick Dempsey, M. McDonald, J. H. Welle and W. King.⏎Patrick Fitzpatrick testified—\"I reside at Willow Springs. I know nothing about the case only what I have heard others say.\"⏎Dr. Kendall testified: \"I have made an examination of the Chinaman. My opinion is he came to his death by strangulation, caused by a rope around his neck, and being hung to a tree. I took him down from the tree about one hundred yards from here, on the Folsom road. I find that the exterior table of the skull is fractured and broken, and there are other marks of violence on the mouth, on the sides of the head, on the forehead and on the legs. Do not think these injuries were sufficient to cause death, as there was no compression of the brain. The hanging was the cause of death. The rope was half-inch Manilla, and had a hangman's knot. The body was suspended with the knot under the left ear. I know nothing further about the case.\"⏎These two were the only persons sworn as witnesses, and the jury, after being out about half an hour, returned with the following verdict: \"We, the jury, are agreed that the deceased (a Chinaman) was hanged by some person or persons unknown to us, which was the cause of his death.\"⏎No money, or other property, was found on the body. As the Justice could get no one in Prairie City to bury the body, it was removed to Folsom and there interred. It is doubtful if any one be punished for this violation of the law and the rules which govern every civilized society.",

It reeks with smells, and sights, and sounds disgusting in the extreme. It is the abode of leprosy, adultery, gambling, and murder.⏎They have their secret tribunals where their victims are done to death according to Asiatic laws, and it is next to impossible for the American laws to find them out.⏎Only last week a Chinaman was hanged in Sacramento who was supposed to have been the victim of Chinese justice. He had first been murdered, and then suspended to a hook in the ceiling to convey the impression of suicide.⏎They were partly betrayed by one of their own countrymen, but he very soon found it advisable to declare that he had made a mistake.⏎They act upon Madame de Stael’s doctrine: Whatever they do is right until they are found out.⏎In short, the most liberal-minded seem willing to concede that if the Chinese have done some good in opening the resources of the country, they have also done some harm.⏎Whatever may be the opinion of any one East or West, the question has reached a grave issue in California.⏎Something must be done.⏎The extreme lower class of the mob is riotous, turbulent, and difficult to restrain.⏎The better-thinking class is quite as determined, if less noisy in demonstration.⏎Mr. Mills is boldly accused of misrepresentation, and his statements have done very much to stir the disquiet in the breasts of the working people.⏎They have discovered that mob violence does them no good, and, having so discovered, they are going to make a very earnest trial of the other course of action.⏎The rumors which travel eastward of threatened outbreaks or violence of any kind are all grossly exaggerated.⏎But such a stand has been taken that it cannot result in nothing.⏎The more popular idea is to limit Chinese immigration, while nothing but fanatics think of driving away those who are here, or abusing them while they remain.⏎After all, it is the millions who threaten to come that people are frightened by, rather than the thousands who are here.",

Among the worst were fires, total lawlessness, and extraordinary precautions taken by the authorities to preserve the peace.⏎The organization of the Committee of Public Safety, with semi-military establishment and numerous counteragents, has been met with strong condemnation.⏎There followed the night of lawlessness all over the southern part of the city, and arson and the attempted burning of a block of buildings in the heart of the business quarter.⏎A NIGHT OF TERROR—A GREAT PANIC—SACKING AND BURNING.⏎A FORMIDABLE DISTURBANCE.Be it proper that special note is made of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company’s dock (or “Old Tebo’s dock”), toward which the mob went with a wild cry of voices, and unprecedented ferocity of movement.⏎Fire-raising was again attempted at the Chinese quarters near the corner of Fourth and Brannan Streets.⏎It was prevented in the nick of time, and serious bloodshed was feared.⏎A large gathering had taken place, and the wash-houses were gutted with total loss to their owners.⏎This incident was but one of many, as more than twenty Chinese wash-houses across Rincon Hill were sacked and burned.⏎The organized elements of the riotous class, calling themselves “the anti-coolie club,” carried red flags and banners with offensive language.⏎It is clear that they did not act spontaneously, but rather through arrangement.⏎When the police engaged the mob, gunfire was exchanged.⏎LOSS OF LIFE.It is estimated that four persons were killed and about twenty seriously injured. Among the dead are two young white men, apparently bystanders.⏎The Chinese death toll is uncertain, though several were seen bleeding and carried off by the rioters.⏎COMPLETELY SACKED.A long line of Chinese establishments on the eastern slope of Rincon Hill were raided and pillaged.⏎Clothing was torn apart and set on fire. Furniture was smashed and thrown from windows.⏎No effective resistance was encountered in those areas.⏎The mob then made its way toward Brannan Street, where gunfire again erupted.⏎A few Chinese men attempted to defend themselves and their homes, but they were beaten back.⏎THE NIGHT.As darkness fell, the scene resembled a battlefield, with gangs of youths running with torches, clubs, and pistols.⏎The fire department was called to various scenes, but some engines were blocked by debris or turned back by rioters.⏎THE ANTI-COOLIE MEETING.A meeting was held at half-past 8 o’clock in Hamilton Hall, where inflammatory speeches were delivered.⏎Banners read “White Labor Must Rule,” and shouts of “Down with the Coolies!” followed.⏎The speakers included known agitators and labor men, who claimed that the Chinese had robbed them of their livelihoods.⏎Several warned that “the people’s wrath must be heard.”⏎RAID OF THE WASH-HOUSES.⏎Large numbers of Chinese wash-houses were visited by crowds of rioters last night, and the sacking and destruction was more general than upon any previous occasion.⏎Commencing at the Chinese quarter on Second Street, the mobs worked southward and westward, entering every place occupied by Chinese and destroying everything that came in their way.⏎The Celestials offered but little resistance, and most of them fled at the first signs of attack.⏎The greatest destruction occurred in the district between Harrison and Bryant, First and Third Streets.⏎The torch was applied to several buildings, and a number of fires were only subdued by the most strenuous exertions of the Fire Department.⏎At one point, on Harrison Street, between First and Fremont, a large brick building was fired and destroyed.⏎It was occupied by about fifty Chinese, who barely escaped with their lives.⏎Some were severely beaten in attempting to save their property.⏎At another place, on Beale Street, a man was seen to fall beneath the blows of the mob and was left for dead in the gutter.⏎Whether he was Chinese or a white man could not be ascertained.⏎A squad of police arrived soon after and dispersed the mob.⏎Scarcely a wash-house escaped damage.⏎All over the city, wherever a Chinese place was known to exist, it was visited and its contents destroyed.⏎Furniture was broken to pieces, bedding torn, and clothing set on fire.⏎At a late hour, bodies of men were still prowling about with the evident purpose of mischief.⏎The streets were filled with debris of broken household goods, and the gutters ran with soap suds and slop from the wrecked laundries.⏎A few arrests were made by the police, but not enough to deter the rioters.⏎The Chinese are in a state of complete terror and many have sought refuge on the water front and in the shipping.⏎Some took boats and rowed to the opposite shore.⏎The scenes of violence and destruction have struck terror into the hearts of the foreign population.⏎All business was suspended in the affected districts, and the people gathered in crowds on the street corners, discussing the situation in awed tones.⏎The attitude of the authorities is more determined than before, and a strong force of special police has been sworn in.⏎The citizens’ committee is cooperating actively with the regular force.⏎If to-night’s demonstrations are as severe as those of last night, it is believed that the military will be ordered out in force.⏎The Mayor is firm in his purpose to restore order at all hazards.",

Fires caused half a million dollars in damage. Several people, including Chinese and white bystanders, were killed or injured. An inflammatory anti-Chinese meeting helped incite the violence, which overwhelmed police until a citizens' committee and fire department intervened.

    "article-transcript": "Again, last night, the pestilent hoodlum gangs committed wanton and atrocious deeds of violence, incendiarism—if not also of murder—in portions of the city. Several Chinese wash-houses were attacked and pillaged and set fire, and in one house, which was consumed, the bodies of two Chinamen were found. It is supposed they were first robbed and murdered by the hoodlums. The Police were on duty in full force all night, and at a late hour order prevailed; but there is danger of nightly outrages until this desperate and dangerous element shall be severely taught that they cannot ride rough-shod over the law without incurring its extreme penalties.⏎The violence of these desperately wicked gangs is in no way attributable to the Associations which are organized into Anti-Coolie Clubs. The members of these Clubs are mostly well-behaved workingmen, who propose to maintain law and order, and their meetings and conduct have so far shown that they are themselves utterly opposed to lawlessness and outbreaks. Their mass meeting on Monday night demonstrated this disposition and determination on the part of the Anti-Coolie organizations, and not one of their appointed speakers gave utterance to an intemperate or incendiary sentiment.⏎The apprehension of danger from the hoodlums has become so grave that, at the instance of Gen. John McComb, of the State Militia, commanding in this Division, the Mayor, Wm. T. Coleman, and a number of influential citizens, a Committee of Safety has been organized for the emergency. It will receive the approbation and support of every good citizen, in the interest of law and order. As things are, every resident is involved in the preservation of peace. Life as well as property is at stake. Let us all engage to protect and preserve both.",

A Chinese cook, employed in a white family named Jessop, made a criminal assault on a little seven-year-old daughter of his employer. The screams of the child brought assistance, when the Chinaman fled and took refuge in a thicket. He was pursued by crowds of excited men, who set fire to the woods. The flames drove the Celestial out, when he was captured. A rope was procured, and the Chinaman was lynched. The whole affair did not occupy twenty minutes. The Sheriff was sent for after the Celestial was dead, but deemed it prudent to make no arrests. The action of the citizens is generally sanctioned.⏎Albert Baker, living near Astoria, shot and wounded a large black bear yesterday. The enraged animal attacked him, and before another hunter could dispatch it Baker was fearfully mangled by the claws and teeth. It is doubtful if he survives his injuries.⏎Mayor Chapman has been interviewed at length regarding the charges of corruption and bribery preferred against him. He frankly acknowledges having signed the contract between himself and ex-Chief-of-Police Besser, but says he was guilty of no breach of the public trust, and boldly declares that there was nothing in the transaction which he is ashamed of.

Soon after the boy came running to his parents, saying that the Chinaman had abused them and had thrown his sister into the water. The parents hurried to where the girl had been last seen, and found her dead, lying in the creek, face downward. An ugly knife cut in the left breast showed her death wound. It is believed that the Chinaman attempted to outrage her, and then killed her, on failing in his purpose, to prevent her making known his fiendishness. The Chinaman was seen making for the mountains. Mr. Eldridge, the father of the child, organized a party of citizens, who were greatly excited, as was also the entire neighborhood, when the foul crime was discovered, and started in pursuit. They returned soon after and reported that the Chinaman could be found hanging to a tree in a canyon, half a mile off. No admission was made of the murderer having been given the benefit of summary justice, and the act seemed to be just what ought to be expected under the circumstances. No questions were asked as to whether the Chinaman was strung up or whether it was a case of suicide.",

The trouble has been growing for days. It was discovered a week ago that there were fully eight thousand illegal names registered in this city, and immediately afterwards the streets were filled with strangers of the worst character. Ever since the publication of the forged Garfield letter violent partisans have striven to make an issue of the Chinese question and the democratic press has been filled with articles asserting that as soon as Garfield was elected the state would be flooded with Chinese and all white labor driven out. Saturday night the democrats had a procession, carrying transparencies tending to excite animosity against the Chinese. A considerable portion became intoxicated, and this noon they made an assault on the Chinese houses, tearing the houses and beating and driving out the Chinese. One was dragged from Hon. Lee’s place with a rope about his neck, and his skull crushed in with boots and bricks. The police were unable to control the mob. The fire department was ordered to throw water on the rioters, but the mob attacked them and badly wounded two firemen. Many Chinamen were fearfully beaten. One was rescued by the police and taken to jail, which was immediately surrounded by a mob of about 1000, who hurrahed for Hancock and yelled “lynch the leper.” About dark the mob were entirely beyond control and marched from street to street, gutting Chinese houses and assaulting citizens. From an isolated tenement a Chinaman was dragged, his ears cut off and otherwise terribly mutilated. He was finally rescued in a dying condition. Several are reported killed. Many colored men were knocked down and beaten. At this hour the rioters are still on the streets in full force. There is a great fear of incendiarism to-night.⏎The transparencies carried in the democratic procession Saturday night were devoted altogether to the Chinese, and this with the constant repetitions of the Garfield forgery, are the causes of the mob.⏎There is a dangerous night ahead. The Chinese population here cannot exceed one hundred and fifty.",

    "article-transcript": "Hanging an Interpreter for Doing His Duty.⏎MONTEREY, July 13.—Yesterday afternoon about 4 o’clock Tom Wong, a Chinese fisherman, familiarly known as “Tom,” was found dead, hanging to a tree in the woods about thirty yards in the rear of the Chinese Mission, near Pacific Grove. Tom was the only Chinese voter in the county and an ardent Republican. He spoke both English and Spanish fluently and knew a little Portuguese. He was frequently engaged as Court interpreter, and the general impression is that he was murdered, from the fact that his head was not more than four inches from the limb to which he was hanging and his feet within three inches of the ground. No inquiry had been made on account of his absence. There are apparent scars on his head and face, and he has probably been dead two or three days. He frequently expressed fears that he would be made away with on account of interpreting adversely to some of the Chinese.",

    "article-title": "Ah Yo, a Chinaman, Thrown Into the River and Shot",
    "article-transcript": "On Tuesday of last week an old, decrepit, harmless Chinaman, 70 years of age, named Ah Yo, who had been living here with his countrymen at their bakery, went to the house of Mr. Jas. Richards, as he said, to ask for some garden greens to eat; upon entering the back yard he met Mr. Richards’ little daughter, and commenced petting her, calling her a pretty little girl, etc. Mrs. Richards seeing it and not understanding him drove him away, and upon Mr. Richards, who was absent, returning home, she told him what had happened, whereupon he started out to hunt up Ah Yo, and meeting him on the levee, forthwith proceeded to give him an awful beating. He was so badly bruised up that he was unable to go to his home for several hours. In the meantime several parties who were under the impression that he had committed a heinous crime, told him if he did not leave town they would hang him. Fearing that the threats against him would be carried out he made his way to the landing, to take the first steamer that came along. Arriving there, in his enfeebled condition, he lay upon the bow of the wharfboat awaiting a chance to get off. While there two men approached, took him up and chucked him overboard into the river. He made an effort to swim out, when he was shot in the head, neck and shoulder, after which he sunk and was seen no more until last Wednesday when the body arose about a quarter of a mile below the place where it happened.⏎Jury of inquest was summoned, who examined and identified the body as that of Ah Yo and made following verdict:⏎We the jury, find that the deceased came to his death from three pistol balls fired by the hands of P. J. Murphy and Pat Reynolds.⏎Whereupon a warrant was issued for the arrest of the parties named, and P. J. Murphy was brought before Mayor Berry on Thursday morning for a preliminary investigation. The case was examined and the defendant was held in $1,000 bonds to the Circuit Court.⏎No arrest could be made of Pat Reynolds, as he had absconded to parts unknown two days before. —Friars Point Gazette.",

Editors:—The large parties from this town and vicinity, who have, for the last week, been scouring the country in pursuit of the Mexican robbers, though unsuccessful in capturing but one, (who was hung in Jackson last Tuesday,) have still been the means of expelling them from the north side of the Mokelumne river. Not a murder or robbery has been committed in this vicinity for the last four days.⏎One of Joaquin’s party, who had been severely wounded in a skirmish a few days ago, was captured near San Andreas on Sunday, and hanged the same day. He made a full confession, and gave an accurate description of Joaquin and thirteen of his party, which will be of much advantage in detecting the others.⏎Last night Joaquin and his party attacked a Chinese camp, near Forman’s Ranch, killed five Chinamen and wounded five others, some of them mortally, and robbed them of seven thousand dollars. I have just seen a letter from Mr. Allen, of Forman’s, detailing the affair, and calling on the people of San Andreas for assistance, and for surgeons to attend the wounded Chinamen. Several excellent horses were stolen by the same party from the Americans, at Jesu Maria Camp, on Sunday.⏎The secret of Joaquin’s successful escapes seems to be in his always being well mounted. As soon as his party ride down one set of horses, they immediately procure others. The horses deserted by them are generally used up, and of no value. Probably a hundred horses have been stolen in this county the past month by this band, and at least thirty persons have been murdered.⏎Large parties are still in pursuit of him, and his escapes seem almost miraculous. When this state of things will end, no one can tell.",
    "article-summary": "In February 1853, Mexican bandit Joaquin and his gang attacked a Chinese camp near Forman’s Ranch, killing five Chinese men and wounding five more. The gang stole $7,000 and later stole horses from Americans. One wounded gang member was captured and hanged after confessing. The violence is part of a broader pattern of robbery and murder across the region, with locals forming posses in pursuit of the outlaws.",
